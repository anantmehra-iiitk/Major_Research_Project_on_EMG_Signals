# Topic : Portable EMG Data Acquisition Module for Upper Limb Prosthesis Application

## Summary : 

a bio-potential acquisition module and a java based GUI is developed to display the real time data.
The hardware module is wireless, portable, power efficient and has eight channels. Section II presents the system architecture
for the proposed system. Section III emphasis on proposed data acquisition model. Section IV describes overlapping windowing technique Section V covers feature extraction process, while section VI explains the EMG pattern classification. Results are discussed in Section VII and conclusion is derived in Section VIII.
