# Summary - 
We have developed a technique using wavelet transform to classify single motor unit (SMU) potentials and to decompose EMG signals into their constituent 
SMU potentials. The distinction between this technique and previous techniques is that it measures waveform similarity of SMU potentials from wavelet domain
which gives this technique many advantages over other techniques. Separation of compound motor unit potentials, on the other hand, is based on a sequence of
waveform differential correlation processes. Our technique also utilizes the information on discharge regularities of SMUs. This technique had been tested using
actual EMG recordings that were composed of more than 10 different motor unit potentials. The results were satisfactory.

Our technique for multi-unit EMG signal decomposition consists of four separate procedures: signal de-noising procedure, spike detection procedure, spike 
classification procedure, and spike separation procedure.
