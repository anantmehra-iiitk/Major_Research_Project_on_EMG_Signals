# Topic : Electromyography (EMG) based Classification of Neuromuscular Disorders using Multi-Layer Perceptron


## Summary of Research paper: 
1)	The aim of this paper is to identify the neuromuscular disease based on EMG signals by means of classification.  
2)	The neuromuscular diseases that have been identified are myopathy and neuropathy
3)	This paper uses ANN for classification.
4)	There are five feature extraction techniques that were used to extract the signals-: 
    a. Autoregressive (AR)
    b. Root Mean Square (RMS)
    c. Zero Crossing (ZC) 
    d. Waveform length (WL)
    e. Mean Absolute Value (MAV)
5)	As a result the authors observed that most of the highest result of classification comes from Autoregressive (AR) methods, four over five groups are classified as the best result from feature extraction techniques. The Root mean square (RMS) can get the two over five of highest result. The Mean Absolute Value (MAV) and Zero Crossing (ZC) can show that they are hard to get better result than others
