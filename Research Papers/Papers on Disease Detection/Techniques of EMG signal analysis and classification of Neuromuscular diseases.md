# Topic : Techniques of EMG signal analysis and classification of Neuromuscular diseases

## Summary of Research paper: 
1)	This paper reviews a brief explanation of the different features extraction and classification techniques for classifying EMG signals used in literatures 
2)	Wavelet Transform (WT), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are different feature extraction techniques. Literature presents different techniques to classify EMG data such as probabilistic neural network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), etc
3)	Artificial neural network techniques are the recent trends for classification of 1-D and 2-D signals. In literature,
classification of EMG diseases done by using various techniques such as feed forward network at different layers (FFNN), back propagation neural network (BPNN), principle component analysis (PCA), Support vector
machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN)


## Result-:
1. Combination of WT and SVM improved the classification accuracy than other
2. Combinations such as DWT with ANN, ICA with MLPN, PCA with ANN and DWT with PNN.
