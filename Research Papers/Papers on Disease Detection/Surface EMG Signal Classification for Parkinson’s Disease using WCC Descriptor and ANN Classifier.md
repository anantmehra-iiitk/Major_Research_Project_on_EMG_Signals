# TOPIC : Surface EMG Signal Classification for Parkinson’s Disease using WCC Descriptor and ANN Classifier

## SUMMARY :
The aim of this paper is to construct an automatic system of neuromuscular dysfunction identification in the case of the Parkinson disease based on surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Our proposed system uses artificial neural network method (ANN) to discriminate healthy EMG signals (normal) from abnormal EMG signals (Parkinson). After detecting the EMG activity regions using Fine Modified Adaptive Linear Energy Detecor (FM-ALED) method, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been used for feature extraction.
Our main contribution is to design an automatic EMG signal classification system for Parkinson’s diseases diagnosis. The proposed system is based on ANN classifier combined with the WCC descriptor and the voting rule. This system enables us to evaluate the developed segmentation system of EMG activity regions (Bengacemi et al., 2020) for the diagnostic task. The main task consists of searching for optimal parameters of ANN model and WCC coefficients to achieve the best classification performances.
