# SUMMARY --- 
The myoelectric signal (MES) is one of the biosignals utilized in helping humans to control equipments. For this we  required to recognize the hand movement. In 
this direction the first step is feature extraction. The optimal feature is important for the  achievement in EMG analysis and control. By this extracted feature 
we reduce the computational cost of a multifunction myoelectric control system. The goal of this paper is to define the methods and approaches which are most suited
for extracting the features from EMG signal. The techniques discussed here are spectral approaches like STFT, Thompson transform etc, wavelet based analysis, 
fuzzy based feature extracter and temporal approaches. 
<br/><br/>
There are various approaches and methods for feature extraction. All approaches have been used in classification of  EMG patterns. The goal of this work is to 
present methods some of existing and successful feature extraction methods.
