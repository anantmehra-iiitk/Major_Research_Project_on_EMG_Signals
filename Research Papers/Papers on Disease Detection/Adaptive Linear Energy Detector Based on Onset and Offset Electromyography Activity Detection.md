# summary -
This paper describes a new approach for detecting onset/offset electromyography activity. The proposed approach is based on energy analysis which has been widely 
used in Voice Activity Detection (VAD). A performance analysis has been carried out in order to get the appropriate frame length of EMG signal to adapt within 
our proposed method. Synthetic and Real EMG signals are used to illustrate us the performance of our proposed method.

Electromyography timing activity detection of human skeletal muscle during movement has important clinical applications. The proposed technique for muscle activity
detection offers important performances suitable for clinical applications. It may be a useful tool for analysis the EMG signals recorded during the assessment 
postural adjustment in Parkinsonian patients.
