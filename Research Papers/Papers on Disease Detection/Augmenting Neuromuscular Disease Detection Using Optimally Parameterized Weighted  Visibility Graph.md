# Topic : Augmenting Neuromuscular Disease Detection Using Optimally Parameterized Weighted  Visibility Graph

## Summary of Research paper: 
1)	we propose a novel neuro-muscular disease detection framework employing weighted visibility graph (WVG) aided analysis of electromyography signals. 
2)	WVG converts a time series into an undirected graph, while preserving the signal properties.
3)	Convectional WVG Graphs are sensitive to noise and requires high computational powers since it is complex.
4)	Two parameters that are targeted for getting more accuracy in the WVG Graph and these two Parameters are:
a.	Penetrable Distance 
b.	Scale Factor
5)	There data sets of EMG signals of Several Persons are taken for the classification and these three data sets are of persons:
a.	Healthy Person
b.	Suffering from Myopathy 
c.	Suffering from ALS 
6)	Using Graph Theory based features we saw that Discriminating capabilities between three classes increases significantly with the increase in values of parameters â€“ Penetrable Distance and Scale Factor.
7)	Three binary (healthy vs. myopathy, myopathy vs. ALS and healthy vs. ALS) and one multiclass problems (healthy vs. myopathy vs. ALS) have been addressed in this  study and for each problem, we obtained optimum parameter values determined on the basis of F-value computed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Using optimal parameter values, we obtained mean accuracy of 98.57%, 98.09% and 99.45%, respectively for three binary and 99.05% for the multi-class classification problem. Additionally, the computational time was reduced by 96% with optimally selected WVG parameters compared to traditional WVG.

Why this research:
1)	EMG is used for diagnostics of various NueroMuscular Diseases by Doctors:
a.	Myopathy
b.	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
2)	EMG Signal Analysis by Doctors is Time Consuming and Sometimes also inaccurate.
